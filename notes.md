My birthday is coming up and I'm planning to put on a bit of a fight night (in the morning), and I need help from all of you. It will be my 30th and I want to do a 30-round gauntlet, where I do 30 consecutive rounds. Any game, any rules, as long as it fits on my mats at home, is a physical challenge, and that you do it with me. Your aim is to break my will and make sure I don't reach the 30th round. You get to pick what thing you're challenging me in. I'll have a whiteboard where everyone can write down their name in the queue and their challenge. 

If you lose, default punishment is 5 burpees, but you can specify your own. 

Sunday 24th July, 29A Etwell St, East Vic Park, fights start at 10am!

Notes: 
- One-on-one only; no ganging up
- Nothing involving things going into or out of my body
	- No food challenges
	- No sexual stuff
	- No stabbings
- Don't actually kill or maim me
- No small joint manipulations
- No nut shots
- Weapons need to be fake and no bigger than a 30cm ruler
- You may request to wear gis

Available equipment: 
- kettlebells (2x 20kg, 12kg, 8kg)
- dumbbells (2x 4kg, 2x 2kg, 2x 1.5kg, 2x 1kg)
- rope
- hula hoop
- resistance bands

Safety:
- My mats have no outside boundaries; beyond the edge lie hard bricks. Take care when pressuring edgewards or taking dynamic actions like shooting takedowns. 
- If one person gets near the edge, allow them space to come back to the center
