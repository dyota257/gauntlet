            <h2>Can I make it to 30?</h2>
            <p>
                I am turning <span class="thirty">30</span> years old this year, and as a trial to cross the threshold and leave my 20s behind, I would like to invite all of you, my honoured and esteemed friends, to put me through a gauntlet of <span class="thirty">30</span> physical challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                I invite everyone to come: you may challenge me, spectate while I get beat up and humiliated, or just come and hang out!
            </p>
            <p>
                Collectively, your aim is to break my body and spirit to make sure I don't reach the <span class="thirty">30</span><sup>th</sup> round.
            </p>
            <p>
                The gauntlet will be <span class="thirty">30</span> rounds of 3 minutes each, with a one minute break in between. Anyone is allowed to challenge me to any game, of any rules, as long as: it fits on my mats at home; is a physical challenge; that you do it with me, and it meets the rules below.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to challenge me, read on. If not, hope to see you for a fun morning!
            </p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <h3>Ordering</h3>
            <p>
                There will be a whiteboard for challengers to write down their name and challenge. Order of challenges will follow this order.
            </p>
            <h3>Judging and punishments</h3>
            
            <p>
                For each round, three judges  will decide whether I pass the challenge or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I fail a challenge, I must do a punishment. Default is five burpees, but the challenger may put forth a different punishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Challengers do not have to do punishments.
            </p>
            <h3>Forbidden!</h3>
            <p>
                These must be observed. Some may look odd, but I would not mention it if someone hasn't already brought it up (you all know who you are).
            </p>
            <p>
                Punishments also must also obey this list.
