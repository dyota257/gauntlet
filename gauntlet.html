            <h2>Can I make it to 30?</h2>
            <p>
                I am turning <span class="thirty">30</span> years old this year, and as a trial to cross the threshold and leave my 20s behind, I would like to invite all of you, my honoured and esteemed friends, to put me through a gauntlet of <span class="thirty">30</span> physical challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                I invite everyone to come: you may challenge me, spectate while I get beat up and humiliated, or just come and hang out!
            </p>
            <p>
                Collectively, your aim is to break my body and will to make sure I don't reach the <span class="thirty">30</span><sup>th</sup> round.
            </p>
            <p>
                The gauntlet will be <span class="thirty">30</span> rounds of 3 minutes each, with a one minute break in between. Anyone is allowed to challenge me to any game, of any rules, as long as: it fits on my mats at home; is a physical challenge; that you do it with me, and it meets the rules below.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to challenge me, read on. If not, hope to see you for a fun morning!
            </p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <h3>Ordering</h3>
            <p>
                There will be a whiteboard where challengers can write down their name and the name of their challenge. Order of challenges will follow the order as written on the whiteboard.
            </p>
            <h3>Judging and punishments</h3>
            
            <p>
                Each round needs to be judged by three judges, who will decide whether I (Dyota) pass the challenge or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I fail a challenge (majority of judges give thumbs-down), I have to do a punishment. Default is five burpees, but the challenger may put forth their own punishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Challengers do not have to do punishments.
            </p>
            <h3>Forbidden!</h3>
            <p>
                These are stipulations that must be observed. Some may look odd, but I would not have put it on here if someone hasn't already forced me to specify (you all know who you are).
            </p>
            <p>
                Punishments also must also obey this list.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>One-on-one only; no ganging up</li>
                <li>One-on-one only for the whole round only; no tagging-in/-out</li>
                <li>Nothing involving things going into or out of my body</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>No food challenges</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>However a non-debilitating amount of alcohol consumption is permissible</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>No sexual stuff</li>
                    <li>No stabbings</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Don't actually kill or maim me</li>
                <li>Weapons need to be fake and no bigger than 30cm in any dimension</li>
                <li>No small joint manipulations</li>
                <li>No nut shots</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Equipment available</h3>
            <p>
                I have some equipment at my house which may be used in challenges. Challengers may bring their own equipment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You may request to wear gis</li>
                <li>You may request to wear kickboxing gear (any/all of gloves, shinpads, headgear)</li>
                <li>Kettlebells (2x 20kg, 12kg, 8kg)</li>
                <li>Dumbbells (2x 4kg, 2x 2kg, 2x 1.5kg, 2x 1kg)</li>
                <li>4kg slam ball</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>My mats have no outside boundaries; beyond the edge lie hard bricks. Take care when pressuring edgewards or taking dynamic actions like shooting takedowns.</li>
                <li>If one person gets near the edge, allow them space to come back to the center</li>
            </ul>
